      <h3>“Safety Training” (Season 3, Episode 20)</h3>
      <p class="img_card__text">
        Michaels pride is hurt when Darryl and the rest of the warehouse crew make fun of the offices safety demonstration. To prove people with desk jobs also face physical dangers, the (ridiculous) regional manager fakes an emotional crisis and stages a jump from the buildings roof — setting up an actually perilous situation in the process.

      <h3>“The Convict” (Season 3, Episode 9)</h3>
      <p class="img_card__text">
        Michael takes a quip from Pam about Dunder Mifflin being worse than prison far too seriously. What results is a cringe-worthy display of Michaels worst early-series tendencies, including the unforgettable debut of Michaels alter ego “Prison Mike.”

      <h3>"The Injury" (Season 2, Episode 12)</h3>
      <p class="img_card__text">
        Michael burns his foot stepping on to a George Foreman grill, and calls reception, screaming for them to drive over and pick him up. Dwight volunteers and crashes his car on a metal pole on his way out, disorienting him. Michael then tries to convince his staff that he has a serious injury

      <h3>“The Dundies” (Season 2, Episode 1)</h3>
      <p class="img_card__text">
        At first, Michaels “Dundies” awards show seems like little more than an offensive opportunity for him to showboat in a Chilis. But when Pams crumbling relationship with fiancé Roy (and burgeoning crush on co-worker Jim) collides with the 8th annual event in this Season 2 premiere, an all-time great “The Office” night-out begins.

      <h3>“Fun Run” (Season 4, Episode 1 and 2)</h3>
      <p class="img_card__text">
        Season 4 is off to the races with the jam-packed two-part premiere “Fun Run.” First, Michael fractures Merediths pelvis when he hits her with his car in the Dunder Mifflin parking lot. Then, Dwight makes the executive decision to euthanize Angelas cat by popping the late Sprinkles in the freezer. In desperate need of pick me up, Michael decides to host a charity 5k.

      <h3>“Stress Relief” (Season 5, Episodes 14 and 15)</h3>
      <p class="img_card__text">
        Achieving the precise opposite of what its title would suggest, “Stress Relief” ranks among the best “The Office” episodes precisely because it manages to do so much in so little time. Its a dazzling display of both the shows witty writers room and its effervescent cast, bringing double the panache to unforgettable moments like Michaels “Boom, roasted!” monologue.

      <h3>“Goodbye Michael” (Season 7, Episode 22)</h3>
      <p class="img_card__text">
        Following a whirlwind engagement to Holly, the former regional manager says goodbye to his employees one by one, before moving to live with his fiancé and her kids in Colorado. The two-part finale is best remembered for a hilarious Will Ferrell performance and its many tearful partings, including Jims “What a great boss you turned out to be” speech, Dwights paintball match in the parking lot, and Pams silent hug set at the airport.

      <h3>“Dinner Party” (Season 4, Episode 13)</h3>
      <p class="img_card__text">
        Michael and Jans toxic nonsense doubles as the main course in “Dinner Party.” Michael tricks Jim and Pam into having dinner at his and Jans condo, the reluctant couple, joined by Angela and Andy, attempts to escape an escalating conflict between the nights not-so-happy hosts. Simultaneously, Dwight scrounges up a date so he can crash the invite-only affair.

      <h3>“Christmas Party” (Season 2, Episode 10)</h3>
      <p class="img_card__text">
        Michael turns what was supposed to be a thoughtful Secret Santa exchange into a vicious Yankee Swap. This leaves Jims meaningful present to Pam — a teapot filled with mementos and an important letter — hanging in the balance. “Christmas Party” is a classic example of Scranton office antics, but doubles as a critical Pam and Jim foundational episode.
